                <h1>Game Development</h1>
                <p>One half year ago I decided to start with game development in Unity.
                    Playing games makes me happier, so the time came, when I wanted to understand,
                    how these processes in the background are working.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So that was the moment I installed Unity and
                    watched a lot of videos and partipated on courses to learn
                    the programming language C# and how to work with the game engine Unity.</p>
                <p>Besides the development of the game, designing is also every important part of game development.</p>
                <p>I love to create pixel characters and animate them.</p>

                <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
                <p>
                    Another part of development I am very interested in,
                    is Deep Learning.</p>
                   <p>I love to evaluate different artificial intelligences for different problems.
                    Together with the game development it's a awesome combination.</p>
                    <p>
                    In the near future I will create an AI for a game, which I created, and should go through without any human help.
                    One part of the artificial intelligence, I have the most knowledge about, is
                    Computer Vision.</p>
                   <p> I participated on a neural network course with this topic and finished it
                    after a runtime of 4 weeks. Additionally I got a personal certificate for it as a proof.

                    Half year ago I participated on a competition for robotics in Berlin.
                    After a year of preparing the robot and the code we were ready for it.
                    This gave me a lot of experiences and showed me, how to
                    work with a lot of pressure.</p>
                <p> Now it's time to teach the other pupils and give them my knowledge. I am very happy about it and will give my best to reach the finals with them!
                </p>
                
                <p>Besides python development and game development I am currently learning Flutter to build
                mobile applications for Android and iOS.

                <p>
                    Since the 5th grade I am very interesting in 
                    technology and development and started with block development.
                </p>
                <p>In the 5th grade I started with developing robots for competitions and learned the basics of development.</p>
                <p>I participated for 5 years on these competitions and got good placements every time, although the hardware didn't work well. After this time I teached myself about new programming skills and languages.</p>
                <p>This woke up different interests in myself and I got fascinating about the huge spread and influence of development in all sections of life.</p>
                <p>I just wanna be a part of it too and wanna help other people to get through the life much easier. </p>

                    Beside development I am playing guitar, 
                    taking photos or going cycling with friends.
                    The rest of the time I am developing and love to create abstract things.

                <p> a clear mind and don't sitting in front of the PC the whole day.
                </p>
                <p>I also love drawing, but I didn't get enough time for it beside development.</p>
                <p>Maybe in the near future I will take more time for drawing and show you my results.</p>
