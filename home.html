                <h1>Game Development</h1>
                <p>At the end of 2019 I decided to start with game development in Unity.
                    Playing games makes me happier, so the time came, when I wanted to understand,
                    how processes in the background are working.</p>
                <br>
                <p>That was the moment I installed Unity and
                    watched a lot of videos and partipated on courses to learn
                    the programming language C# and how to work with the game engine Unity.</p>
                <p>Besides the development of the game, designing is also every important part of game development.</p>
                <p>I love to create pixel characters and animate them.</p>

                <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
                <p>
                    Another part of development I am very interested in
                    is Deep Learning.</p>
                   <p>I love to evaluate different artificial intelligences for different problems.
                    Together with the game development it's an awesome combination.</p>
                    <p>
                    In the near future I will create an AI for a game, which should go through without any human help.
                    One part of the artificial intelligence, I have the most knowledge about, is
                    Computer Vision.</p>
                   <p> I participated in a neural network course about this topic and finished it
                    after a runtime of 4 weeks with a certificate.

                <p>
                    At the beginning of 2020 I participated in a competition for robotics in Berlin.
                    After a year of preparing the robot and the code we were ready for it.
                    This gave me a lot of experiences and showed me, how to
                    work under a lot of pressure.</p>
                <p> Now it's time to teach the other pupils and pass them on my knowledge. I am very happy about it and will give my best to reach the finals with them!
                </p>
                
                <p>Besides python development and game development I am currently learning Flutter to build
                mobile applications for Android and iOS.

                    Since the 5th grade I am very interested in 
                    technology and development and started with block development.
                </p>
                <p>In the 5th grade I started with developing robots for competitions and learnt the basics of development.</p>
                <p>For 5 years I have been participating in these competitions and got good placements every time, although the hardware didn't as planned. After this time I taught myself about new programming skills and languages.</p>
                <p>This woke up different interests in me and I got fascinated about the huge spread and influence of development in all parts of life.</p>
                <p>I just want to be a part of it, too and want to help other people to get through the life much easier. </p>

                <h1>My hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                    Beside development I am playing the guitar, 
                    taking photos or going on trips with friends.
                    The rest of the time I am developing and love to create abstract things.
                    
                </p>
                <p> These hobbies give me a good balance and time off from <br>
                    development to get </p>
                
                <p> a clear mind and not to be sitting in front of the PC the whole day.
                </p>
                <p>I also love drawing, but I haven't got enough time for it besides learning and practicing.</p>
                <p>Maybe in the near future I will take more time for drawing and show you my results on my social media account.</p>
